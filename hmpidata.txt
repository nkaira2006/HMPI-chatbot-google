Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HMPI) is a quantitative method used to assess the overall level of heavy metal contamination in groundwater. It combines the concentrations of multiple metals into a single index value to evaluate water quality. HMPI is especially useful in environmental monitoring and public health studies.
The HMPI formula is:
HMPI = ∑(Wi × Qi)
Where Wi is the unit weight of the ith parameter, and Qi is the sub-index of the ith parameter based on its concentration and permissible limit.
A commonly used threshold value is 1.0. If HMPI exceeds 1.0, the water is considered polluted and potentially harmful for human consumption.
Heavy metals commonly monitored in HMPI studies include lead (Pb), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and chromium (Cr). These metals can cause serious health issues such as neurological damage, kidney failure, developmental disorders, and increased cancer risk.
In a 2025 study conducted in the Eastern India mining belt, researchers analyzed 60 groundwater samples across seasons using HMPI, GWHI, NSFWQI, and fuzzy-GIS techniques. They found that 17.7% of the region fell into the “Worst Hazardous Zone.” Groundwater was unsafe for drinking in most areas due to high salinity and heavy metal content. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that anthropogenic activities like mining and agriculture were major contributors to contamination.
Another study in Nalagarh Valley, Himachal Pradesh, compared HMPI, Contamination Index (Cd), and Heavy Metal Evaluation Index (HEI). Researchers proposed a new index called Heavy Metal Contamination Index (HCI), which classified water quality into six categories. They found that HCI provided clearer classification than HMPI and used the Delphi method to assign weights to different metals.
A 2025 study in Kirkuk, Iraq analyzed 40 groundwater samples using HMPI and GIS. HMPI values ranged from 3.55 to 148.68 depending on the season. About 75% of the samples were deemed unsafe for human consumption. Surface water also showed significant contamination. The study compared results with WHO and EPA standards.
HMPI is a valuable tool for policymakers, environmental scientists, and public health officials. It helps assess water safety, plan irrigation strategies, and guide interventions in contaminated regions. It also enables seasonal and spatial analysis of pollution trends.


Groundwater pollution due to heavy metals is a growing concern worldwide, especially in regions with rapid industrialization, mining, and agricultural runoff. Heavy metals such as lead (Pb), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) are commonly found in contaminated groundwater. These metals are non-biodegradable and tend to accumulate in living organisms, making them highly toxic even at low concentrations.
Sources of heavy metal contamination include industrial discharge, mining activities, agricultural fertilizers and pesticides, landfill leachate, and sewage effluents. Once these metals enter the groundwater system, they can persist for decades and spread across large areas through aquifers.
Exposure to heavy metals in drinking water can lead to severe health issues. Lead affects the nervous system and is particularly harmful to children, causing developmental delays and cognitive impaiment. Arsenic is a known carcinogen and can lead to skin lesions, cardiovascular disease, and various cancers. Cadmium damages the kidneys and bones, while mercury affects the brain and can cause birth defects. Chromium exposure is linked to respiratory problems and cancer. Nickel and zinc, though essential in trace amounts, can become toxic when concentrations exceed safe limits.
In a 2025 study conducted in Gaya, Bihar, researchers analyzed groundwater samples for ten heavy metals using ICP-OES. They found that aluminum and iron exceeded permissible limits in over 50% of samples, while arsenic and nickel posed carcinogenic risks in 36% and 46% of samples respectively. Children were found to be more vulnerable than adults due to higher ingestion rates and lower body weight. The study emphasized the need for continuous monitoring and targeted mitigation strategies.
Another review from Galgotias University highlighted that chronic exposure to heavy metals in groundwater can lead to genetic disorders, neurotoxic effects, and long-term environmental degradation. The authors stressed that heavy metals are among the most hazardous pollutants due to their persistence, toxicity, and ability to bioaccumulate through the food chain.
Globally, groundwater is considered a reliable source of drinking water for over 2 billion people. However, its natural filtration process is not sufficient to remove heavy metals. Contamination often goes undetected until health issues arise, making it a silent threat to public health. Strategic planning, regular testing, and sustainable water management practices are essential to prevent and mitigate the risks associated with heavy metal pollution in groundwater.
